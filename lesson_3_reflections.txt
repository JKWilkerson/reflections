When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with multiple people or on multiple computers or with people at great distances from one another.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To keep track of the state of the project as you work on it in chunks, so you aren't working on files that are changing.
